Because reliability is the most critical feature in software industry and because a lot of operational tasks are still done manually, SRE aims to automate as much as possible the post-deployment phase.

## SRE mantra

SRE core values can be summarized as conciliating between pace of innovation and product stability.
The SRE prerogatives include the availability, latency, performance, efficiency, change management, monitoring, emergency response and capacity planning of their service(s).

## Build observability system

A central part of SRE mission is to enable :
- **logs** to ease diagnostic
- **alerts** when an operator needs to take actions
- **ticketing** for prioritizing tasks after incident

## Demand Forecasting

Availability cannot be separated from an accurate estimation of the needed capacities. Hence, a member of SRE team is responsible for provisioning adequate resources and implement auto-scaling whenever it's possible.

## Performance

As performance is a function of capacity and costs, SRE aims to adjust the provisioning strategy for a given software deployment.
