We help building effective Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment pipelines so that production roll-outs become a routine task. 

## Containerized artifacts

Take advantage of application containerization to build portable artifacts which can be run either locally or on production environment. Ease the configuration management with tagging and secured built image on a private registry.

## Tests and Code Quality

Introducing a stage of integration and non-regression tests in the deployment pipeline allows to secure roll-outs and perform early anomaly detection. We can also bring our expertise to add code quality checks.

## Infrastructure testing

At the end of deployment, infrastructure properties can be checked programmatically to ensure it is compliant to corporate security rules.
